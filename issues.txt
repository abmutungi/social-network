CreatePosts

- Currently if user chooses custom privacy, there is no logic. 
Also on the backend, there is a field in the db for privacy,
but if the option is custom with a set of friends, 
how are we going to input the data

- Routing for createPost hasnt been defined. Possible solution is that
we use localhost:5173/createpost/{userId}
